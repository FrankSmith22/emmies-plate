# Emmie's Plate
A personal project between my wife (as web designer) and I (as web developer) to create a website (and maybe eventually an app) that is our take on a useful recipe website.

The program will pull from one or more recipe APIs using ingredients as search criteria to show recipes in a clean and organized way. Instead of having to deal with annoying website ads and unclear instructions, we hope to develop a site that will be useful to us when searching for meals. The site will also allow users to save their own recipes in a separate part of the app, likely to be some kind of database. 

List/Table of functional and non-functional requirements to be provided soon.
